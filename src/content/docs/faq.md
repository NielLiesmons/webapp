## General

### What is Zapstore?

Zapstore is an open Android app store built on Nostr. Apps are discovered through your social graph, releases are cryptographically verified, and developers can receive Bitcoin payments directly from users.

### How is Zapstore different from Google Play?

Zapstore has no central gatekeeper. Anyone can publish without app-store approval, and trust comes from signatures, social context, and reputation instead of a single platform operator.
Developers receive payments directly. No ads, no forced tracking, and no platform cut.

### Is Zapstore open source?

Yes. The app and publishing tooling are open source. You can review the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/zapstore/zapstore).

## For Users

### How do I install Zapstore?

Download the APK from [zapstore.dev](/) and install it on Android (10+, arm64). You may need to allow installs from unknown sources.

### How does social discovery work?

Zapstore uses your Nostr social graph. While browsing, you can see usage and recommendations from people you follow, which helps surface useful apps without paid ranking systems.

### Are apps on Zapstore safe?

Apps are signed by developers, and signatures are verified before install, so you can confirm who published a release.
Zapstore is still permissionless, so use normal software safety habits: check developer reputation, read community feedback, and prefer developers you trust.

### How do I support developers?

You can send Bitcoin directly via Lightning zaps through your Nostr identity. No separate account or payment processor is required.

## For Developers

### How do I publish an app?

Use `zsp` and run the wizard:

```bash
zsp publish --wizard
```

The wizard walks you through source, metadata, signing, and publishing. See the [publishing guide](/docs/publish) for details.

### Do I need to pay or register?

No. Publishing is free and requires no registration. You just need a Nostr keypair to sign your releases.

### How do I receive payments?

Add a Lightning address to your Nostr profile. Users can zap you in the app, and you receive 100% of each payment.

### What signing methods are supported?

`zsp` supports:
- `nsec` or hex private key
- Browser signing (`NIP-07`)
- Bunker URLs (`NIP-46`)

## Technical

### What is Nostr?

Nostr is an open protocol for decentralized social networking. Zapstore uses it for identity, app metadata distribution via relays, and social features like follows and zaps.

Learn more at [nostr.com](https://nostr.com).

### How does verification work?

Developers sign releases with their Nostr key, and that signature is published with release metadata. On install, Zapstore verifies the signature against the developer pubkey.
This confirms provenance and helps detect tampering.

### What relays does Zapstore use?

Zapstore reads from and publishes to a default relay set, and you can configure additional relays.
Because relay infrastructure is decentralized, there is no single point of failure.
